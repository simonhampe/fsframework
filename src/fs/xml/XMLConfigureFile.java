/**
 * Represents a file that is used to store, read and apply
 *  configurations in XML formats. Several XMLConfigurable objects
 *  can be registered at one instance of a XMLConfigureFile. The XML file will
 *  be interpreted as follows: For each registered XML-Configurable a first-level node
 *  that bears the name of the corresponding ID will be selected and passed on for
 *  configuration. If there are several of this name, only the first one will be passed on.
 *  If there is none, the configure()-Method will simply not be called.
 * <br> As for writing, if a node for an ID does not exist yet, it is created. If it exists, the
 *  first occurrence will be overwritten and any further ones ignored. Note, 
 *  that XMLConfigureFile gives no further guarantees as to the order of the
 *  nodes.

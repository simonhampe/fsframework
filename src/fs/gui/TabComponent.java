/**
 * This class implements a component that can be used as an easier-to-use
 * extensible tab component. It is derived from JPanel (and will by default be
 * non-opaque), so it can be manipulated like a standard component. It can be
 * configured to automatically select the associated tab in a JTabbedPane after
 * mouse click. However this can also be realised manually by adding an
 * appropriate listener. Sub-components can be added with a special method,
 * addClickTransparent(Component c) or by registering them as clickTransparents,
 * so that every mouseClicked event on that component will be forwarded to the
 * main JPanel (i.e. potentially interpreted as tab selection and also forwarded
 * to every MouseListener registered the normal way).

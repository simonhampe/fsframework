# fsframework
This is a collection of java tools I wrote ages ago. Most of them are used in fsfibu2 (https://github.com/simonhampe/fsfibu2). 
Most notably, this contains a small programm called polyglot which is used to modify and administrate the propietary language files used in fsfibu2.
I suspect that most of these tools might be superfluous nowadays (I haven't actually checked), I mainly keep this repo as a backup for myself.
In particular, this code is not being maintained in any way.
